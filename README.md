Minetest Schematic Downscaler

Work in progress.

Currently only works for the edgy-dark-ominous game because of the microblock naming scheme.

Ensure that your schematic has even dimensions, otherwise a crash will happen.
Ensure that the nodes you are using have defined microblocks, otherwise nothing will happen.
